# SICP

These are my exercises and study notes for [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), a classic work in computer science.

The exercises are completed in [clojure](http://clojure.org/), a lisp dialect on top of the JVM. As such, I'm using [SICP Distilled](http://www.sicpdistilled.com/)

# Starting the Project

    docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/usr/src/app sicp

# Developing

1. Make edits to the clojure files
2. Restart the Docker container
